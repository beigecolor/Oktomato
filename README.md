# Project 1 : OkTomato
OkTomato is our full-stack application that lets users browse and create movie reviews.
## Planning

### Scope
MVP
A static page with
* reviews section
* submission form
* responsive design

### User Stories

Types of users: 1) just browsing reviews, 2) reviewers.

As a browser, I want to
- read movie reviews 

As a reviewer, I want to
- create a new movie entry
- add a review for an existing movie
- rate movies
- edit and delete existing movies/reviews

## Implementation

### Approach
We began developing from Outside-In, or building from the front-end into the back-end, and then connecting them.

### Technologies Used

### Unsolved problems
We struggled to translate our five-star rating into the something the database could understand and save. In the end, we scrapped it.
